Fall Detection Using Ultra-Wideband Radar and Capsule Network

We propose a fall detection method from radar time-frequency representations. A radar time series is derived from the ultra wideband radar return signals. The time-frequency representations are obtained by applying STFT. The resulting spectrograms are used as input to the deep capsule network for automatic feature learning.
